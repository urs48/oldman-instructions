		<ul><li>
			Set it on a suitable space and compose a hint. The hint can be an audio/video/text. <br><u>Send this hint and the location of basement to the mediator</u> to verify it's validity. The mediator will then post the hint onto the Whatsapp group.</li>

			<li>After pacing yourself away from the basement, send your location to the mediator within <u>every minute</u> to track your path. The mediator will then blacken the regions on the map and post on group.</li>	</ul>	
			<p>
				Therefore, your only comrade to communicate with, is the mediator. <u>Do not</u> send your locations to the group to hide your identity and presence on the map. Although you will have the privilege to <i>view other player's locations after your path is updated to them</i>.
			</p><p>
			As you won't be active on the group, the investigators would have an idea, that it is you who is the old man. Wisely, choose the direction on the map to escape the investigators.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> You are also given the privilege of <b>powerhouses</b>. Upon reaching the following locations you can shut down a major area of the map, thus speeding up the process of blacking out the entire map.</li></ul>

				<p>You must <i>send your location to the mediator to verify that you have reached the powerhouses</i>, and the mediator will update the investigators of the blackened regions respectively.
				</p> 
				<p>
					To <u>view the range of blacked regions</u> that the powerhouses provide, you must share this game with 2 of your friends &#9786. Upon sending it's proof (screenshot) to the mediator, the regions will be made visible.</p>

						<b>The investigators can split up to either locate you or your basement to end the game faster.</b><br> Hence, use the advantage of powerhouses wisely. The location of powerhouses are <u>not available</u> to investigators immediately and the range of blackout won't be visible to them unless you reach that location.
					</p>
					<h6>What to do when you are caught?</h6>
					<p>If they have finally trapped you; they will ask you your <u>starting location</u> and post on the whatsapp group to confirm that you are captured.
						<br><i> The game thus ends.</i>
