The student investigators did know the source began from the garbage elements but they couldn't narrow it down to what.<br>

"The loner took a few samples of the garbage and cow dung patty. They emptied one packet on the street and kept one of their phones close to it. As soon as it started glitching, he pulled phone away to save it from further malfunctioning.
They performed various tests on the remaining samples; filtering them in UV light, microwaving it and exposing them to radio signals. After around five minutes all the samples turned green which was unusual.<br>
They had a few samples left. They decided they needed to medically diagnose them. So they visit one of the cheap in-house hospitals in Yelahanka. They pay a male nurse to perform stool tests on it without questions.<br>
The nurse couldn't perform most of the tests which didn't involve x-rays as the machines seem to abnormally stop working. But the ones he did perform were similar like the ones the boys tested. He showed them the results that underwent x-ray tests. There were certain things visible. They looked like<b> herbs</b>. The herbs glowed fluorescent green but he couldn't diagnose what it was. For advanced tests they would need a medical practitioner's consent. The boys didn't have the funds to go further."</i></p>
